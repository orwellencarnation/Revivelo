# Introduction

***Who we are***

Libre Router is a technology-based company dedicated to the development of innovative solutions directed towards **data privacy** and **sustainable cyber security**. Our **mission** is to enable people to protect themselves from unwanted data transactions and cyber intrusion. Behind the business model, our **purpose** is no less than **all-out internet data protection**. To achieve this goal, our product implements a wide arrayal of software and hardware technologies, perfectly tuned and turned into a plug-and-play device. 

***Why should we care about data privacy and security?***

We all care about data privacy and security to some degree, of course. We also know how far reaching the **ethical implications** of this issues are, specially for people working with sensible data, being an activist or a physician. There are also economical implications: it is  evident to any person running a business how strong data security, strategic knowledge, and value assesment relate to each other. On the other side, in our informational global era it is almost a truism to state how indispensable team-work, communication and in general data flow across regional and transnational boundaries has become. To keep a long story short: **you use internet, right? Then you should care**.

***If everybody uses the internet the way it functions, where is the problem?***

It is not the way the internet functions, but the way we use it. All the technologies needed to use it productively and simultanously enhance security and privacy are available, even free. 

Our data are prone to be captured alike by cyber-criminals, data-greedy corporations, and governments that care more about the transparency of citizens than about the transparency of their administration. This is the more so given the fact that most of our communication occurs through the services of those data-greedy corporations, that governments can obligue the former to deliver data to them through law enforcement, and that both possess the financial leverage to hire the most skilled cyber-criminals to pursue their interests.

Additionally, as soon as we open a door to the internet, every attack to compromise the device is possible, and more probable to happen if we are "on the road" with one of the two most widely spread comercial operating systems. Such a situation ends up exposing even those sensible data we were in the first place never disposed to transfere over the internet. There are situations where a lot of convenience with a little bit of security is not enough, we need plenty of both. To stay productive and valuable, to be responsable with our customers, our informants, or even to safe lifes. 

***But, we have a firewall, antivirus-software and a AdBlocker installed!***

Sure, there are a lot of standarized security meassures implemented in every computer today, but many of the threats to our privacy and data security do not depend exclusively on the features of one node in the network -your computer- but are intrinsic to the way most people uses the internet: centralized services of communication and storage, closed source software operating this services, unencripted data transfer, and lack of anonymisation.

***How to work secure, productive, valuable and responsable with sensible data***

Privacy configuration is important when surfing through the internet. To be protected you need the necessary infrastructure: a grid with _resilence_. Through the _community grid_ (formed by the robust network of our devices) the information is encrypted before leaving your computer, then it is encrypted again and distributed in paths. Thus, to read it becomes virtually impossible for anyone but the owner of the device. Further, it is possible to restore all your files from the grid, even if your device is destroyed, still avoiding central storage in third-party clouds. The implementation of our community grid avoids viruses, exploits and protects you from malicious internet traffic transparently, with no additional button or additional software. 

Know-how, reliability, technical and economical convenience -all of it integrated in a plug and play device- that is the added value we deliver. https://ksr-video.imgix.net/projects/1830782/video-546980-h264_high.mp4

***Our commitment to sustainability***

Our philosophy at Libre Router is based on the pillars of **sustainable cybersecurity**: **data anonymisation, data decentralisation, e-mail encryption, ad-blocking and filtering, indestructible storage, green energy efficiency and social collaboration**. LibreRouter has been developed to be an open source hardware with no malicious backdoors in the used programs, with transparent source code for kernel logic as well as firmware where open source developers will have as much control as possible to bypass censorship and ensure security for the users.

***But, what kind of people care about sustainable cybersecurity?***

Our target group is based on early adopters (people interested in new gadgets), citizens and companies in conflict-ridden countries, value-conscious consumers (people who care about sustainable consumption) and pro-free-download as well as anti-advertising internet users who look for **security, productivity and comfort**.

# Attributes of Libre Router

![Issues_Safegaurds](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/14-WithTextCorrections.png)


## Our solutions in a nutshell

 This is a list of the technical attributes of the solutions implemented in Libre Router. Together they provides all-out Internet data protection:

1. Libre Router runs on a **open-source linux operating system** with a security-hardened version based on Debian Libre and LFS. 
2. Implementation of alternative, **decentralised** cloud-services at a local level, avoiding big-data-corporations.
3. **Decentralisation and anonymisation of the Search Engine**, avoiding tracking and providing full control over the relevance criteria of search results  (also allowing you to filter irrelevant content).
4. **Filter-connection for Social Networks**, which allows to check the news-feeds of several social networks in one single place and filter irrelevant content using the decentralized social network _Friendica_.
5. **Decentralisation of video conferences** based on _XMPPoverTOR_ or _WebRTC_.
6. **Secure storage system** with collaborative tools based on _TahoeLafs_ (encription and decentralisation) over _i2P_ (anonymisation) and _blocksnet_.
7. **Transparent e-mail encryption**. Encryption occurs before e-mails leave your computer and decryption only after they reach the local and secure network of the reviever, who then can read the e-mails normally (transparency).  
8. **Encompassing network protection** through anonymous web traffic enforcer, Ad-blocker, intrusion prevention system, anti-virus and anti-tracking technology for your web browsing, filtering viruses, exploits, malware, ads, bad reputation IPs, and tasteless content.
9. **Protection** from different services that track data transactions like Internet proxy, _clamav_, _surikata proxy_, _snort unbound DNS lists_, iptables, etc.
10. **Self hosted obfuscated authentication** dissolves the legal relation between the human-user and legal-name, forcing encryption in transport and in rest data.
11. **Network filtering of metadata** that expose you, like scripts, cookies, browser info, meta-data of files, etc.


## Our services in detail


***1. Decentralised collaboration storage system - Based on OwnCloud***

Libre Router offers decentralised collaboration to share your files with friends, business partners or another people being automatically protected and anonymous. Download files stored in your private cloud, anonymously and with just one click, allowing online **collaborative editing**, **file-sharing** or **backup of your mobile photos** in your community grid. This cloud-technology is provided by the project OwnCloud and you will find a ready-to-use deployment of it in Libre Router.

***2. Decentralised anonymous search engine with admin rights - Based in YaCy***

With Libre Router you are the administrator of your search engine giving you full power. You can blacklist undesirable content, give relevance to your favourite websites and, the best part, **nobody tracks your search**.
The power of the underlying technology -YaCy- resides in the decentralised design: every user is part of the search engine and contributes to the quality of search results without the need of a central search-engine provider farming your data, sending you ads, and manipulating the results of your search according to their commercial or political interests.

![data center or decent-ralization](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/11-12_v2.png)

![search engine](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/31_v2.png)


***3. Filter-connector for your social networks in one single place - Based in the decentralised social network Friendica***

What YaCy is to search-engines, Friendica is to social networks. It not only provides a decentralised platform for social sharing of content with all popular features (shares, likes, comments, etc.) and effective privacy settings. It makes Libre Router the smart way to use social networks, acting as a unified entry and outgoing point for all of your posts across social networks, allowing you to retrieve content from, and push content to other services you may already use (like Facebook or Google+) without compromising your privacy. Additionally, it enables you to filter out irrelevant content from other social networks, leaving in your news-feed only  what is important to you.
Libre Router provides out of the box and through the community grid a network of secure and decentralised servers of Firendica.

![socialnetworks](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/33.png)


***4. Secure video conferences - Based in XMPPoverTOR or WebRTC***

We have also thought about your need of secure internet-telephony and video conferences. With Libre Router you can easily get in touch with your friends or family on a private way: the communication is secure and protected from third party intrusion. Your computer connects directly to another without a middleman. 

XMPP is a open, specialised  protocol for this kind of services that allows decentralisation. Combined with the anonymisation service of TOR it provides secure and private communication through the internet. WebRTC is a similar technology that processes all communications on a peer-to-peer basis. This means, again, without the need of a centralised server which can store or monitor your communications. 

Via a third technology called rtc.io, Libre Router implements this solutions in a convenient and user-friendly client. You use it just as any other video-conference software.


![rtcio](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/8-9_v2.png)



***5. Transparent Email encryption for your actual email - Based in MailPile***

Every single e-mail is encrypted by Libre Router in the most secure way: end-to-end encryption. This means that encryption occurs before e-mails leave your computer and decryption only after they reach the local and secure network of the receiver, making it impossible for a third party to read your mails, even when using popular services.
As in all our other services, we have got your back when it comes to convenience:

- You can continue using your actual e-mail provider securely.
- You can profit from encryption using any device (also mobile) inside the network of Libre Router.
- Transparency means, you read and write e-mails as if they never where encrypted.

![34-35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13025157/19035791/0cc2588c-896c-11e6-88a2-fbf83dc3abfe.png)

***6. Selfhosted e-mail server***

Aditionally, Libre Router delivers also a self-hosted e-mail server. In this way you can -if you prefer- completely cut out other providers as the middleman of e-mail traffic in your organisation.

***7. Decentralised marketplace***

In the same vein of other decentralised, self-hosted solutions delivered by Libre Router, we also offer a marketplace service 
running on our device. If you are an enterprise selling products over the internet, this will give you full control over contents, transactions, and all data related to your marketplace.

***8. Decentralised indestructible storage; the Rock-Star app***

Imagine all the important information you have stored on the hard drive of your computer. You are just one hardware failure away from disaster. After all, when did you do your last backup? Local solutions of data-storage are either fragile (one-point failure), or expensive: no normal user maintains at home several servers with automated and redundant backups. And even then - being in one place - they are exposed to be destroyed all together by a disaster or to be stolen.

Unfortunately, centralised storage solutions such as Dropbox and Google Drive also present a variety of issues. You're at risk of having your data hacked and stolen or delivered to governments by dubious law-enforcement  if it’s not encrypted. (A real example was the shutdown of the cloud-storage service Mega by the FBI in 2009). 
  
Libre Router solves both problems. It delivers a secure storage system with collaborative tools based on TahoeLafs over i2P and blocksnet. What are all this technologies? Well, the people at TahoeLeafs developed not only an excellent software but also wrote a neat explanation of how it works:

"Tahoe-LAFS is a system that helps you to store files. You run a client program on your computer, which talks to one or more storage servers on other computers. When you tell your client to store a file, it will encrypt that file, encode it into multiple pieces, then spread those pieces out among multiple servers. The pieces are all encrypted and protected against modifications. Later, when you ask your client to retrieve the file, it will find the necessary pieces, make sure they haven't been corrupted, reassemble them, and decrypt the result.

The client creates more pieces (or "shares") than it will eventually need, so even if some of the servers fail, you can still get your data back. Corrupt shares are detected and ignored, so the system can tolerate server-side hard-drive errors. All files are encrypted (with a unique key) before uploading, so even a malicious server operator cannot read your data. The only thing you ask of the servers is that they can (usually) provide the shares when you ask for them: you aren't relying upon them for confidentiality, integrity, or absolute availability. (provider-independent security)"

(We strongly encourage you to read the whole description at https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/browser/trunk/docs/about.rst)

Even the origin of your data-pieces is not traceable, due to the anonymisation of data-transfer provided by i2p; blocksnet allows to distribute and restore your data in the community grid without ever being neither complete in one single place nor readable for others.

Of course, Libre Route takes from you the hassle of deployment and configuration, integrating all this pieces into our device and making them function like a Swiss clockwork.  


***9. Anonymous administration web-ssh and native ssh over tor and i2p***

***10. Intrusion prevention system (including SSL encrypted connections) ***

***11. Wireless intrusion prevention system***



***12. Web application firewall (including SSL encrypted connections)***

***13. Ad-Blocking, Web content filter and parental control***

Advertising not only derogates the quality of your internet-experience. It can be also the path to unsecure sites or simply unwanted (or even disgusting) content. Libre Router acts as a gate-keeper of all your internal network, blocking ads and filtering unwanted content for all devices in the network. You don't have to worry about installing and updating plug-ins for each device.
Pre-configured lists of site-filtering help you at home to enforce parental control. But also in the case of workstations in a professional environment you may want to filter out distracting sites that affect the productivity of your co-workers. The tools are all there, ready to use, in Libre Router.

![web content filtering 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13025157/25559815/0fe41d7c-2d43-11e7-8be3-c6cfec7e72bb.jpg)

***14. Network antivirus (including SSL encrypted connections)***

If network-wide ad-blocking and content-filtering is convenient, network-wide antivirus protection is crucial. You really don't want to rely on every antivirus software being updated on each device. Libre Router obviates this administrative task for you and eliminates a source of human failure with this feature.

![carving-diagram 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13025157/25559800/b236bed2-2d42-11e7-8671-93ca1dee06d8.png)

***15. E-mail antispam and antivirus with TLS enforcement***

To round off our security features that filter malicious and undesirable bites, Libre Router also provides antispam and antivirus e-mail filter for all devices in your network. Additionally, TLS-enforcement guarantees that messages to specific business partners on a per domain basis are always sent or received encrypted. Messages to and from Enforced TLS domains that cannot be sent encrypted fail to be delivered to avoid exposure of the email content in plain text format on the internet. The feature also allows to require that certificates are issued by a trusted certificate authority, helping to make man-in-the-middle attacks less likely to succeed.

# Technical Overview, licenses and certifications

![gridstorage](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/16.png)

The decentralized (i2p) version of Tahoe LAFS-Grid (with protections against Sybil attacks and upload Dodos) is a new way to make your data indestructible. A grid splits your files up into little pieces, encrypts them, and spreads them out geographically, making the data immune to any disaster or service outage.
In our decentralized system your valuable information is encrypted three times:
1. Before it even leaves your computer, in the web browser
2. In the collaboration tool before the data goes to the hard disk
3. When backing up to the grid, the slices will also be encrypted.

#***Overview of Linux Libre and Libre Kernel for personal cyber security and privacy***

##Overview of Libre Kernel components:

##***Introduction to what is called a 'Pseudo Backdoor' (a secret entry door in the program's code)***

Software components with no available source code (how the program was made) are called binary blobs (Binary Large Objects) or a collection of binary data stored as a single obscure object. As such, they are mostly used for proprietary firmware images in the Linux kernel like hard drives, Ethernet, USB controllers, graphic cards etc. Though generally redistributable, binary blobs do not give the users the freedom to review the source code, or any other programmer the ability to check the program itself, audit, scrutinize, modify or, consequently, redistribute any further evoluted version.
[Blob Example](#blob-example)



The following image shows how Libre Router protects you by sitting between the outer Internet and your private network

#Technical Overview

##***Technical documentation: About Linux Libre***

Linux Libre is a free/Libre version of the Linux kernel suitable for use with the GNU Operating System.
It removes non-free components from Linux that are disguised as source code or distributed in separate files. It also disables run-time requests for non-free components, shipped separately or as part of Linux, and documentation pointing to them. The GNU Linux Libre project takes a minimal-changes approach to cleaning up Linux, making no effort to substitute components that need to be removed with functionally equivalent free/Libre ones.

As explained earlier, it's an operating system kernel and a GNU package whose aim is to remove from the Linux kernel any source code with blobs, with obfuscated source code, or proprietary licenses. Software components with no available source code are called binary blobs and, as such, are mostly used for proprietary firmware images in the Linux kernel.

##Ways of Proprietary firmware removal and its good effects

1. Deblobbing : This is the cleaning up and verification of Linux tarballs and patches for non-Free blobs. This is done using the script files deblob-check for verifying the Vanilla Linux kernel tarball for any non-free proprietary blobs. Similarly, for removing the blobs there is a scripts deblob-* where * represents the Kernel version it's tested and applicable for. The script can be found here <http://www.fsfla.org/svn/fsfla/software/linux-libre/scripts/>

2. VRMS(Virtual Richard M. Stallman)
A program that analyzes the set of currently-installed packages on a Debian-based system, and reports all of the packages from the non-free tree which are currently installed. Software gets categorized in the non-free tree when it is agreed not to be too problematic for 
Debian to distribute but does not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines and, therefore, cannot be included in their official distribution. For each program from "non-free" installed, VRMS displays an explanation of why it is non-free, if one is available. More information about VRMS can be found at <https://alioth.debian.org/projects/vrms/>

3. Keep the base deblobbed kernel compilation clean:
Use clean basement and don't allow installation of 3rd party software that is established by trust control as free of blobs. An example of this for Linux Libre can be found at <http://www.linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/releases/LATEST-4.6.N/> 

###Kernel

The Linux kernel is a Unix-like computer operating system kernel. The Linux operating system is based on it and deployed both on traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions[9], and on various embedded devices such as routers, wireless access points, PBXes, set-top boxes, FTA receivers, smart TVs, PVRs and NAS appliances. The Android operating system for tablet computers, smartphones and smartwatches is also based atop the Linux kernel.
The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds[10] for his personal computer with no cross-platform intentions, but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures, many more than other operating systems or kernels.

Debian vanilla kernel:
- Doesn't include any non-free firmware (bugs aside), but it allows users to load non-free firmware if they wish to do so, which might pose the same kind of threats as Trojans, tracking, kernel training with malicious software, sniffing, etc.
	
Linux Libre kernel:
- The Linux Libre kernel doesn't include any non-free firmware or anything looking like firmware, and it prevents users from loading non-free firmware even if they wish to do so.
- Is built by running a deblob script on the kernel source code. This goes through the kernel source code and makes various firmware-related changes. 
- Any firmware for which source code is available is preserved, but the script must confirm that the source code is available. 
- Any module requiring firmware is stripped of the ability to load it. 
- Any source code which looks like firmware (sequences of numbers) is removed. 
- Any file containing only firmware (e.g. the contents of firmware/radeon) is removed. 
	
##Libre Router

In the previous section we talked about Linux Libre which is a Linux based operating system kernel and a GNU package.
In this and the following few sections we are going to talk about its counterpart called LibreRouter which is no more than an Open Source hardware with no malignant backdoors in the used programs, with source code for kernel logic as well as firmware where Open Source developers will have as much control as possible to bypass the censorship and ensure security for the users.

After a series of tests requested, I must say that we are not using any type of non-free package, passing vrms does not detect any.

root@librerouter:~# vrms

No non-free or contrib packages installed on librerouter!  rms would be proud.
root@librerouter:~# 

DPKG
checking contrib/non-free

root@librerouter:~# dpkg-query -W -f='${Section}\t${Package}\n' | grep ^non-free
root@librerouter:~# dpkg-query -W -f='${Section}\t${Package}\n' | grep ^contrib
root@librerouter:~# aptitude search '~i ?section(non-free)'
root@librerouter:~# aptitude search '~i ?section(contrib)'

BLOBS

The blob-check script has found one blob in the current kernel of debian jessie, it is related to the free driver of nvidia, maybe it is a false positive but it will be removed when the free kernel (fsfla) is implemented in its entirety.

root@librerouter:/usr/src# /bin/bash deblob-check linux-source-3.16.tar.xz 
linux-source-3.16/drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/engine/xtensa.c within
linux-source-3.16.tar.xz
root@librerouter:/usr/src# 


In the simplest terms it's a GNU Free and Open Source Hardware (FOSH) running GNU software.

A unique integration of open source hardware by GNU software maintained by the Open Source community.
With minimal training and simple documentation you can achieve a decrease in cyber risks levels and increase your privacy.
The aim is to make it really very easy to use for all people, even those without technical computer and networking knowledge, while serving as a simple plug and play system to make your traffic untraceable and secure. It is the future of home networking and only privacy viable data center infrastructure. 

##Open Source Hardware

![ddvdvdvd](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/correction_bulk.jpg)

It consists of physical artifacts of technology designed and offered by the open design movement. Both free and 
open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware are created by this open-source culture movement and 
apply a like concept to a variety of components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as free and open-source hardware (FOSH). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it - coupling it closely to the maker movement. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical 
drawings, schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code and integrated circuit layout data), 
in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/Libre terms. The original 
sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant 
evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for investors.

### Licenses for being open

####LGPL (Lesser General Public License):
The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). 
The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate software released under the LGPL into their own 
(even proprietary) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source 
code of their own components. The license only requires software under the LGPL be modifiable by end users via source 
code availability. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library such 
as a DLL, so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL is primarily used 
for software libraries, although it is also used by some stand-alone applications. Please visit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License> 

####CC (Creative Commons) License:
A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of 
an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, 
and build upon a work that they have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose 
to allow only non-commercial uses of their own work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's

###***Hardware openess license and confusing "open" terms***

The market is full of crowdfunded projects where the funders claimed that the project is based in open hardware.
What becomes evident following extensive research is that they require the operation of a full range of so-called binary blobs (possible backdoors), chipset restrictions (software required to be signed by the manufacturer), and questions about missing or obfsucated documented parts or schemas/diagrams. The result could be any of these possibilities:

- ARM Trustzone is a blackbox: TrustZone technology within Cortex-A based application processors is commonly used to run trusted boot and is a trusted OS to create a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Typical use cases include the protection of authentication mechanisms, cryptography, key material and DRM. As you can imagine this is a big antiopen market mechanism.

- Device drivers: the controllers or chipset may not be opensource (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver)
- No source code or the compiler is not opensource
